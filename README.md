# C_DataStructures_Library
This project is meant to form a library with every data structure and its functions. The main library is grouped in sub-librarie. Every sub-library has the basic algorithms for any problem that can be faced while using a specific data structure. The project is made in C and the main reason of doing this is the usage of the knowledge I gained in the second half of my first academic year at University Politehnica of Bucharest.

# The content of the library:
## 1) Vectors
## 2) Matrices (with simple array and 2D array)
## 3) Stacks
## 4) Queues
## 5) Binary search trees
## 6) AVL trees
## 7) Heaps
## 8) Hash tables
## 9) Graphs (both oriented and not oriented)
## 10) Greedy method
## 11) Backtracking
